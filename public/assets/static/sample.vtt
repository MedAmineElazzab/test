What exactly happens in our stomachs
when we eat? Even before we have taken

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the first bite of a meal, the brain sends
impulses to the stomach. These impulses

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
start the production of secretions in
the stomach and the upper part of the

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
stomach, which acts as a reservoir,
expands. The food passes into the stomach

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
through the cardia at the stomach
entrance. This is a muscle that acts like

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
a valve, closing the top of the stomach.
The top part of the stomach, the fundus,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is where food and the air that we swallow
with every bite is collected. This is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
where the stomach volume starts to adapt.
The fundus is an extremely adaptable

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
structure. The more food goes into the
stomach, the more it actively expands.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In the middle part of the stomach, called
the body, gastric juice is produced and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
mixed with the mass of chewed food. The
main component of gastric juice is

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
gastric acid. This eliminates bacteria in
the food and also helps to prepare the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
food for the following stages of
digestion. The muscular contractions of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the stomach wall churn the food mass and
mix it with gastric juice. Three

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
contractions per minute move the food
mass back and forth. After a certain time,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
passed in small quantities into the
intestine via the pylorus. As the stomach

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
empties, it gradually returns
to its previous size.
